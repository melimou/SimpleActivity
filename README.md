Hi! I am learning/experimenting with android recently and I am adding the mini projects that I do on my github. 
This first project is a simple tow-activity app that has two functionalities: get an input phone number and open the built-in dialer app to with that number.
In this app I focued on how to work intents between different activity (so no fancy graphics! sorry).
